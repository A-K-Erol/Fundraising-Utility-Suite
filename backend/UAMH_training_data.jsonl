Gallup ranked Ukraine only 38th out of 44 on the World Happiness Index, and Ukraine was among the ten countries with the highest rate of suicide.The full-scale invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated mental health challenges and led to a sharp deterioration in psycho-emotional wellbeing.  The World Health Organization reported that following the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, 9.6 million Ukrainians are at risk of developing psychological disorders, driving demand for increased psychological support services. Public resources provided by the Ministry of Health are insufficient to address the issue. Therefore, it is critically important to develop independent programs that offer psychological support and promote emotional wellbeing, especially through non-governmental public organizations. Ukraine Mental Help is a charitable institution that was established in 2022 to provide psychological assistance to Ukrainians impacted by the war.  Given our extensive experience in providing psycho-emotional assistance with qualified specialists, we are uniquely positioned to help meet the psychological needs of Ukrainians."}]}
