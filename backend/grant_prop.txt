1. ISSUE BACKGROUND
OLD: [220 words]
The essence of the problem:
The World Health Organization indicates that after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, about 9.6 million Ukrainians are at risk of developing psychological disorders (https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/scaling-up-mental-health-and-psychosocial-services-in-war-affected-regions--best-practices-from-ukraine)
Even before the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Ukraine was ranked 38 out of 44 in the world "Happiness Index" - according to the international Gallup International survey, which was conducted in Ukraine by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation and KMIS in January 2022. Also, in 2021, Ukraine was among the TOP-10 countries in terms of the number of suicides in the world - 24-32 cases per 100,000 people.
Thus, the full-scale war exacerbated the mental problems of Ukrainians, the psycho-emotional state deteriorated sharply, and the demand for psychological support increased. The state, represented by the Ministry of Health, is trying to solve this problem, but the state resources are not enough. Therefore, it is critically important to implement and develop independent programs of psychological support and development of cheerfulness of Ukrainians, including through the efforts of non-governmental public organizations.

Issue Background:
The full-scale invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated mental health challenges and led to a sharp deterioration in psycho-emotional wellbeing.  The World Health Organization reported that following the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, 9.6 million Ukrainians are at risk of developing psychological disorders, driving demand for increased psychological support services.
Public resources provided by the Ministry of Health are insufficient to address the issue. Therefore, it is critically important to develop independent programs that offer psychological support and promote emotional wellbeing, especially through non-governmental public organizations.
UA Mental Help is a charitable institution that was established in 2022 to provide psychological assistance to Ukrainians impacted by the war. Given our extensive experience in providing psycho-emotional assistance with qualified specialists, we are uniquely positioned to help meet the psychological needs of Ukrainians.
2. ABOUT US
OLD:
In working with persons who have applied for help, we are guided by case management - a method of comprehensive work with applicants, provision of services in accordance with individual needs for effective and targeted psychological support.
Over the past year, we have provided psychological assistance to more than 3,000 people and now provide more than 1,000 consultations every month with the help of 47 specialists: psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatrists.
In May 2023, the project aimed at reducing the impact of war on the mental health of Ukrainians ended. According to the project, it was planned to provide 1,700 50-minute consultations from December 2022 to May 2023. The planned indicators were exceeded and 2,642 consultations were provided for 320 beneficiaries. In total, 355 individuals received assistance via individual and group support (320 and 35 accordingly), including 4 GBV survivors, 15 persons with disabilities, 3 LGBTQ+ representatives, and 62 children under the age of 18.
As part of the project, 6 psycho-educational webinars were held, attended by 476 people.
Conducted 2 courses of " Self-Help Plus" groups, 10 sessions total, which were visited by 68 beneficiaries
As part of the project, training was conducted for the involved specialists according to the mhGAP protocol. MhGAP (mental health gap action program) is a WHO program that aims to address health service gaps and reduce the significant burden of mental, neurological and substance use disorders on a global scale.
Specialists of our organization have experience working with both children and victims of gender-based violence and in their work are guided by the relevant standards and protocols of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee was established in 1992 as part of UN General Assembly Resolution 46/182 by the heads of a wide range of organizations belonging to the UN system and independent humanitarian organizations.
One of the areas of activity of the "UA MENTAL HELP " CI is the provision of long-term psychological assistance to persons who have contacted the relevant hotlines. Our institution has concluded memorandums and agreements with the following organizations:
-               krisenchat gGmbH - psychological counseling service for children and adults;
-               Lifeline Ukraine Charitable Foundation, which provides support to people experiencing suicidal thoughts or emotional crisis;
-               Public union "National Psychological Association", which, in particular, provides psychological help hotline services in Ukraine and abroad.
These organizations refer to us persons who have contacted the hotline to receive long-term psychological help and to eliminate the reasons that lead them to suicidal thoughts and actions.
